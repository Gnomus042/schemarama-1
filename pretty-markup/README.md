A tiny demo for displaying pretty ladder-like structured data using schemarama. <br />
<img src="/pretty-markup/assets/preview.jpg?raw=true" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

To run it, please bundle schemarama to **schemarama-parsing.bundle.js** according to the [guide in the core part](https://github.com/google/schemarama/tree/main/core) 
and put it to this folder, then just 
open demo.html with your favourite browser.<br/>
You can change the markup in the input textarea on the top of the page,
structured view will be updated after every change.
